A Zero to Complete Introduction to Managing AWS Using Python

*Please note this is a Work in Progress*

## Who should be reading this?

This is intended as an introduction to both Python and AWS DevOps using Python. There will be a primer on both concepts, focusing on getting the basics quickly and then applying those skills in increasing complex ways until you are able to deliver a microservices-oriented software ecosystem through an entire software development lifecycle (like those used in large enterprises) primarily through these tools.
This shouldn't be viewed as the only way to do it, but one that has worked in various organizations.
