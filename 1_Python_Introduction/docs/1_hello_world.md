# Hello World
Here we are going to introduce Python. We'll be running Python 3.6, although it doesn't matter for this exercise. This is the most simple python script, simply printing out "Hello World"

```python
print('Hello World')
```

Running this will get us:
```
â‡’  python3 ../code/1_hello.py3
Hello World
```
